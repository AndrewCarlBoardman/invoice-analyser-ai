# Invoice Analyzer AI

This is a mini-project that uses **Azure Form Recognizer** to extract structured data (e.g., vendor name, customer name, invoice date, and total amount) from uploaded invoice images or PDFs.

Built using **Streamlit**, this tool allows users to:
- Upload one or more invoices
- View extracted data in a user-friendly format
- Export results to CSV
- Handle South African invoices (ZAR currency)
